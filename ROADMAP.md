## Build recipe



### Project Information Architecture

* build a '.json' object that models the site-map (pages and copy)
* setup unit and end-to-end test to verify that there are html files for each page sepcified in the '.json' specs
* add plugin to CMS to enable site owner to reset it to the initial build I provided them.
